# postgraduate-D78
Today is finally a holiday. I'm really speechless. After these days, I still haven't asked me to do anything. I really don't know how to write this PS, but fortunately there's still some time. I have to start doing something next week. Otherwise, PS really can't write it. There is also the English exam. This thing is a heavy start. Now I finally find that it's completely impossible to prepare for the postgraduate entrance examination and go abroad again and again. Today's advanced part of MySQL is over, but the actual operation of MYCAT failed. It's hard. It's been a day, but it didn't succeed, and I don't know why. Now I feel disgusted to see others prepare the same things as me. I don't know why. There are still a lot of things to do. Let's talk about it first.
